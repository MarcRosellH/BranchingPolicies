## Concept

Branching methods in projects help teams to work in parallel and to solve any problem or implement features in a simpler way, so that, there are policies to maintain control over all of them.
Branching Policies are a set of rules created to help teams protect their branches of development. These policies enforce team's code quality and management. 

To see the benefits of using Branching Policies, we will take a deeper look to two different ways of working with branches. The first one being a light branch policy and the second one with a much more strict policies, that is used by companies.
